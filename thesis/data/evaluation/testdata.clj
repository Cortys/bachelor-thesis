  "Dr. Lu,

  I would be grateful if I could talk with you some time about the typical
  terms one sees in Swing, take or pay, virtual storage, etc. options.
  This
  is related to some research some colleagues and I are doing applying
  recent
  innovations in Monte Carlo valuation of options with early exercise.  We
  would like to illustrate our techniques on some examples which look
  realistic.  When would be convenient for you?

  I look forward to talking with you.

  "Hello!

   Your conversation with Dr. Seppi unfortunately doesn't contain any negation.
   I'm not writing this message because I have something to say,
   I just need an example message that contains negation.

   John"}]
